This is it. I might actually start writing down all my thoughts now. I've been wanting to do this for a long time but I
never found a way that sticked with me. After multiple different tries, hopefully this medium will be the right one. The 
reason I want to do this is because I often have some thoughts / reflections / ideas that I feel could give some value if 
they were put out into the world for other people to reflect on them and consequently to try to move society in a positive 
way. In other words, attack difficult, meaningful, and important questions so that we are able to make the correct decisions 
about our future as a society. 
Thanks.
